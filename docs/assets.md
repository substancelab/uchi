# Assets

Uchi comes with a stylesheet generated by Tailwind and a compiled Javascript file, but you don't have to settle for the defaults.

## Javascript

The script tags for the default Javascript are rendered by `app/views/layouts/uchi/_javascript.html.erb`. In order to replace all of Uchis clientside scripts, add that template to your host application and load whatever scripts you need in it.

If you want to extend the existing Uchi clientside code, include a

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag "uchi/application", "data-turbo-track" => "reload" %>
```

in `app/views/layouts/uchi/_javascript.html.erb` to still include the default scripts.

### Stimulus

Uchi uses [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) for interactivity and exposes the Stimulus object as `window.uchi.application`. If you wan't to extend the Stimulus instance in your own assets, for example to register custom controllers, you can use that object in your scripts:

```js
import MyController from './controllers/somewhere.js'
if (window.uchi.application) {
  window.uchi.application.register('my-controller', MyController)
}
```

## Stylesheets

The CSS includes for the default styles are rendered by `app/views/layouts/uchi/_stylesheets.html.erb`. In order to replace all of Uchis styles add that template to your host application and include whatever styles you need in it.

If you want to extend the existing Uchi CSS, include a

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "uchi/application", media: "all", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
```

in `app/views/layouts/uchi/_stylesheets.html.erb` to still include the default styles. For example, to change the background color to red (which I am not sure is advisable), you can include the following in the partial:

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "uchi/application", media: "all", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
<style>
  body {
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>
```
