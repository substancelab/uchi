# How to customize

While Uchi comes with a set of sensible defaults you'll inevitably find the need to customize things to fit your application.

## Main navigation menu

The default navigation menu renders a sorted list of all the [repositories](/repositories) included in Uchi. If you want more control over how this is done, you have a few options:

1. Override the component
2. Generate your own navigation partial

### Override the component

The navigation is generated by a View Component called `Uchi::Ui::Navigation`. If you add a component with that name in your application (probably at `app/components/uchi/ui/navigation.rb`) you can customize how your main navigation menu is rendered:

```ruby
module Uchi
  module Ui
    class Navigation < ViewComponent::Base
      def call
        "This is my navigation"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

See [ViewComponent docs](https://viewcomponent.org/) for more details.

### Your own navigation partial

If you want even more control over the navigation menu, including being able to remove it entirely, you can add a partial in your application at `app/views/uchi/navigation/_main.html.erb`.

Creating your own navigation partial gives you full control over the navigation menu, including the `nav` element that wraps the navigation area, allowing you to remove the menu entirely by rendering an empty partial.
