# Uchi
## Admin framework for Rails applications

## Installation

### 1. Install the gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "uchi"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

### 2. Install Uchi

```bash
$ rails generate uchi:install
```

### 3. Create a repository

Add a repository for one of your models by running

```bash
$ rails generate uchi:repository Customer
```

This adds a repository in `app/uchi/repositories/customer.rb`, a controller to use that repository in `app/controllers/uchi/customers_controller.rb` and a route to `config/routes.rb` to send requests to the controller.

You can now visit http://localhost:3000/uchi/customers - welcome to Uchi :)

Next up; customize your repository to return the fields you want to expose.

## Fields

Each repository defines a method, `#fields`, that returns the fields to include in the views in that repository. For example, a `Customer` repository could return its fields as:

```ruby
class Uchi::Repository::Customer < Uchi::Repository
  def fields
    [
      Field::String.new(:name),
      Field::Date.new(:started_on),
      Field::BelongsTo.new(:company),
      Field::HasMany.new(:agreements),
    ]
  end
end
```

Uchi comes with a bunch of fields that you can choose from, fx:

- `Field::BelongsTo`
- `Field::Boolean`
- `Field::Date`
- `Field::DateTime`
- `Field::HasMany`
- `Field::Number`
- `Field::String`

If none of the above works for you, you can create your own and use those.

For more details about fields see the [Fields documentation](docs/fields.md).

## Repositories

The cornerstones of Uchi are the repositories. This is where you configure what parts of your models you want to expose and how to do it.

There's a one-to-one mapping between a repository and a model. So if you have a `User` model that you want to include in Uchi, you must have a `User` repository as well.

### Model inference

For the most part the model class for each repository is inferred from the repository class name, ie `Uchi::Repository::User` manages the `User` model. In some cases you might need to specify the relationship explicitly. You can override the `Uchi::Repository.model` class method in that case:

```ruby
class Uchi::Repository::Something < Uchi::Repository
  def self.model
    ::SomethingElse
  end
end
```

For more details about repositories see the [Repositories documentation](docs/repositories.md).

## Translations

Everything is localizable and translatable out of the box.

### Fields

Repository fields are translated using translation keys on the form `uchi.repository.<repository name>.field.<field name>`. For example, the translations for a `User` repository could look like:

```yaml
en:
  uchi:
    repository:
      user:
        name: "Name"
        password: "Password"
```

Field translations not specified in the `uchi` scope will default to whatever we get from Rails' `Model#human_attribute_name`.

### Repositories

Repository names are based on the models they manage. Their translation keys are on the form `uchi.repository.<repository name>.model` and should have pluralization options. So a `UserRepository` would look like:

```yaml
en:
  uchi:
    repository:
      user:
        model:
          one: user
          other: users
```

Repository translations will default to whatever we get from Rails' `Model#model_name.human_name`.

### Views

Copy on views can be translated specifically for each view. Their translation keys are on the form `uchi.repository.<repository name>.view.<view name>.<element key>`. For example to translate the "Add" button on the index view for the `UserRepository` you'd use the following translation:

```yaml
en:
  uchi:
    repository:
      user:
        view:
          index:
            add: "Create %{model}"
```

## Authentication

### Basic authentication

The simplest way to lock your admin interface down is to enable basic authentication in your `Uchi::ApplicationController`:

```ruby
module Uchi
  class ApplicationController < Uchi::Controller
    http_basic_authenticate_with :name => "uchi", :password => "rocks"
  end
end
```

See https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic.html for more advanced examples.

## Existing authentication

Uchi exposes a helper method (both in views and controllers) called `#uchi_user`. By default it calls the global `current_user` method, so it should work with Devise and most Rails authentication systems.

In order to require the user to be logged in, you could do something like

```ruby
module Uchi
  class ApplicationController < Uchi::Controller
    before_action :authenticate_user!

    private

    def authenticate_user!
      return if uchi_user

      # Insert more details authentication requirements here, for example:
      # return unless uchi_user && uchi_user.admin?

      redirect_to main_app.new_user_session_path, :alert => "You must be signed in to access this section."
    end
  end
end
```

### Not using `current_user`?

If you expose the current user model via another method name, override the `uchi_user` method in your `Uchi::ApplicationController`:

```ruby
module Uchi
  class ApplicationController < Uchi::Controller
    def uchi_user
      current_employee
    end
  end
end
```

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/substancelab/uchi.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Principles

### Defaults are defaults

Rely on defaults whenever possible. If something has already been decided for us by Rails or Flowbite or Tailwind use their decision.

### I18n is opt in

We don't want to force you to translate everything. If a field doesn't need a translation, don't add one, we'll just fall back to the fields name.
